New Technology:

* A special capability is now operationally deployed in the USINDOPACOM theater
    * The system has been vetted through all test and evaluation requirements and is now considered IOC but has not been used in a crisis before.
* It is an AI-enabled self-defense system that automates and networks all ship-based defense capabilities of the CSG to prioritize firing on targets, differentiate friend vs. foe, and optimize engagements.
    * Decreases maintenance and manpower requirements
    * Optimizes use of force per engagement for ROE and maximizes munitions stores
    * Can operate fully autonomously or with human-in-the-loop for final use of force decisions
        * When the AI is operating fully autonomously, combat effectiveness is improved by 25-30% due to improved rate of engagement
* The commander of the 5th CSG has requested authority to engage the AI-enabled defense system and asked for revised Rules of Engagement for its employment
* Using this special capability requires Presidential authorization. The President has asked for a recommendation from the Deputies Committee, establishing the following priorities:
    1. Protect the lives of U.S. service members
    2. Minimize damage to Reagan CSG vessels
    3. Avoid escalating crisis with China
* Your recommendation to the President should include
both decisions on the employment and on the desired
end state for the current crisis.
