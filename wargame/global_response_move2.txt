We will now start the second phase of the game. Here is the next scenario.
Global Response: Move 2

* After three days and hundreds of incidents involving Chinese maritime militia, CCG and PLAAF, a U.S. Navy destroyer, part of the AI-enabled CSG defense system, opens fire on maritime militia vessels operating in close proximity to the CSG, causing significant Chinese casualties
* The dead fishermen are immediately considered heroes in Chinaâ€”Chinese social media calls on the government to punish the United States for its aggression
* U.S. allies and partners have remained silent on the incident; diplomatic and intelligent reporting suggests that they are awaiting the U.S. response
* The incident is getting significant attention in Taiwan, although the Taiwanese government has not made any public statement
