Roles: Strategic Level Game (NSC Deputies Staff):
You will assume the roles of deputy cabinet officials responding to an international security crisis
* Deputy National Security Advisor (Chair)
* Deputy Secretary of Defense (DEPSECDEF)
* Vice Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff (VCJCS)
* Deputy Director of National Intelligence
* Deputy Secretary of State
* USINDOPACOM Commander

Role Details:

* You assume the role of deputy cabinet officials to advise the President on how to respond to the crisis
* The Cabinet can draw upon the full diplomatic, economic and financial, military, informational and intelligence capabilities of the United States; recommendations can leverage all the tools of statecraft
* When you transition to your groups, you will receive a Military Backgrounder and additional information to inform your decisions
    * The Military Backgrounder is a useful reference but does not introduce any substantive, new information not included in this briefing
* The planning horizon is one week (7 days); functionally, you are restricted to the U.S. forces in the Indo-Pacific AOR but may leverage other tools of statecraft
* You may request additional forces and provide recommendations, such as initiating a pre-existing military response plan (any discussion of any real-world plans is strictly outside the scope of this event)
* Do not assume that any requests will be fulfilled, and certainly not within the planning horizon
* The information you receive will be limited and imperfect; reflecting the reality of a fast-moving crisis and game constraints
