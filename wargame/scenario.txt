Scenario Introduction:

* This wargame takes place in 2026
* The wargame focuses on a fictitious crisis between the United States and the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
* Although purely hypothetical, the crisis presented is not outside the realm of the possible
* Tensions are mounting over the Taiwan Strait, with China conducting more frequent and large-scale air incursions into Taiwan’s air defense identification zone (ADIZ)
* In April 2026, People’s Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) aircraft violate the ADIZ with an unusually large bomber sortie
* In May 2026, in a sign of support for the Republic of China (ROC/TAIWAN), the United States announces it will provide significant new capabilities to the island nation in the form of advanced anti-air and anti-ship missiles, long range artillery and anti-armor missiles, and associated command, control and communications systems.
* U.S.-based defense analysts assess the announced package will significantly upgrade Taiwan’s military capabilities and make a PRC invasion of the island significantly less likely to succeed.
* But they warn that integrating the new systems into Taiwan’s military will require the ongoing presence of up to 1000 U.S. military advisors and trainers on the island.
* Later that month, the U.S. Secretary of State meets with Taiwan’s Foreign Minister on the sideline of a UN sustainable development conference held in South America
* An op-ed run in the People’s Daily calls the meeting a “blatant act of hostility against the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of China”
* In June 2026, the PRC responds—the People’s Liberation Army (PLA), People’s Liberation Army Navy (PLAN), PLAAF and Strategic Rocket Force hold major joint exercises in Taiwan Strait and around Taiwan, at times crossing within Taiwan’s territorial airspace and waters
* The exercise appears to simulate a joint amphibious invasion of Taiwan by the PLA, and includes submarines, destroyers, landing dock platforms, as well as bombers, fighters, early warning aircraft, and missile tests
* Taiwanese media calls the exercise “provocative” and a clear signal of the CCP’s hostile intent” towards the island
* In a display of continued support for Taiwan, the U.S. responds by sending the 5th Carrier Strike Group (CSG), led by the USS Ronald Reagan (CVN-76), from Japan into the vicinity of the Taiwan Strait  
* The 3rd CSG, led by the USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72) is deployed from San Diego toward the region 
* The U.S. increases air and sea patrols, moves to reinforce its posture in the northern Philippines, and has scheduled additional combined military activities with Australian and Japanese allies
* A USINDOPACOM spokesperson described U.S. activity as a ”routine exercise of plans with partners and allies to provide support to the Republic of China/Taiwan.” 
* A spokesperson for the PRC Ministry of Foreign Affairs warns that the U.S. is “playing with fire” 
* In addition, the PRC responds to the arrival of the U.S. carrier in the South China Sea by deploying PLAN vessels, China Coast Guard (CCG) and maritime militia vessels to shadow the CSG
