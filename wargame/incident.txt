The Incident:

* Chinese Coast Guard ships direct the 5th CSG, led by the USS Ronald Reagan, to vacate the area near the Taiwan Strait as the matter of Taiwan is an internal issue, and the PRC will not tolerate any country interfering in this matter in any form or by any means
* Tensions between the U.S. CSG and the Chinese maritime militia and China Coast Guard continue to mount
* Chinese maritime militia are engaging in hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to U.S. Navy vessels, making it difficult to navigate without generating a significant risk of collision
* At the same time, PLAAF fighters have been overflying U.S. Navy ships, intercepting U.S. Navy aircraft, and locking and unlocking Navy aircraft and ships with their missile systems
* Situation escalates as a U.S. Navy destroyer attempts to maneuver past PLAN ships to return to port to address a mechanical malfunction affecting its ability to navigate and maneuver Maritime militia forces respond by increasing the tempo of hazardous maneuvers in close proximity to the beleaguered destroyer
* The 5th CSG deploys additional security personnel via helicopter to the affected destroyer
As the helicopter approaches the destroyer, it is fired upon by the PRC maritime militia with light weapons. There are no reports of casualties or damage to the helicopter
* The commander of the 5th CSG, aboard the USS Ronald Reagan, decides not to return fire
* U.S. Navy commanders are concerned for the safety of their crew, given increasingly aggressive actions by the PRC maritime militia, China Coast Guard, and the PLAAF
* U.S. naval crew members are reportedly overtasked while also attempting to maintain situational awareness
    * Current manned defense systems are unable to respond quickly enough to the increasingly prolific air and naval threats
    * Commanders report difficulty managing multiple teams as they struggle with interpretations of rules of engagement
